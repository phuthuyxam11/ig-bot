        Form validation is a difficult subject in frontend, not only you have to
        deal with ensuring correct values are submitted, you also should provide
        a pleasant UX for your users.
      </p>

      <p>
        Doing form validation by hand is a lot of work and you won't probably
        cover all your needs if you decide to build your own.
      </p>

        <b
          >The time you spend working on a custom form validation solution is
          better spent building your application logic.</b
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        Most validation libraries will save you a lot of time, but vee-validate
        tackles the major pain points of form validation and addresses them in a
        very flexible way:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Tracking form state</li>
        <li>UI and UX</li>
        <li>Synchronous and Asynchronous Validation</li>
        <li>Handling submissions</li>
      </ul>

      By only handling the complex stuff, vee-validate gets out of your way of
      building your awesome forms.
